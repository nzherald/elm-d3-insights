  # Welcome to the NZH Insights template

  This is a [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) based template designed to make it
  quick to get up and running
  with [d3](https://d3js.org), [d3-jetpack](https://github.com/gka/d3-jetpack),
  [elm-lang](http://elm-lang.org), [sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [bourbon with bitters](http://bourbon.io)
  and [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for text blocks (_like this one_).


  The pattern assumed is that the elm portion of the app will be responsible
  for user interaction, data loading - handling - and storing, and the bulk of
  the rendering, with d3 just being used for creating self contained components.

  It is assumed that the d3 plotting function call is idempotent and the elm portion
  of the app will call that function upon initialisation, when data is loaded or changed, and
  when the browser is resized.
