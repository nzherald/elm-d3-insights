  # Welcome to the NZH Insights template

  This is a [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) based template designed to make it
  quick to get up and running
  with [d3](https://d3js.org), [d3-kit](https://github.com/twitter/d3kit),
  [elm-lang](http://elm-lang.org), [sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [bourbon with bitters](http://bourbon.io)
  and [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for text blocks (_like this one_).


  The pattern assumed is that the elm portion of the app will be responsible
  for user interaction, data loading - handling - and storing, and the bulk of
  the rendering, with d3 just being used for creating self contained components. d3-kit
  is used to provide a responsive scaffolding the charts.
